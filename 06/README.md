## Description

My solution to the [Tampa.rb Codernight Ruby Quiz #14](https://gist.github.com/ambethia/5960316).

Attempt to solve the problem using tested OOP code.

Approached the problem by creating an initial array of arrays for each
number. Started by parsing the numbers passed in and adding them to a larger 
array of arrays that gets merged together and displayed. 

Failed to get methods working that adjust the size of the display.

## Usage

`./lcd.rb 1234`

## Testing

` rake test`
